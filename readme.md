### Description

This sample application demonstrates how to bridge up the CAN Bus and Wi-Fi peripherals on the WFI32E device which is running in SoftAP Mode. This concentrator device allows to connect the physical CAN-bus to WLAN network. A third-party STA will connect to the WFI32E SoftAP device and a third-party CAN Bus node ([Microchip CAN Bus Analyzer](http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/APGDT002)) will connect to the CAN Bus of the WFI32E device.

</p>

A TCP Client on the third-party STA will then connect to the TCP Server running on the WFI32E Bridge device. Once connected, the WFI32E device will be able to transmit or receive the network data from the TCP Client. The WFI32E device can also transmit or receive CAN Bus messages from the third-party CAN Bus node.

In this example, the CAN messages are sent from the [Microchip CAN Bus Analyzer](http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/APGDT002). The WFI32E Bridge device forward the CAN Bus messages to the TCP Client (python script) running on a third party STA (computer). The TCP Client (python script) echoes the same message back to the SoftAP device and the WFI32E forward the message back to the CAN Node ([Microchip CAN Bus Analyzer](http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/APGDT002)).

### ATA6553 click

The [ATA6563 click board](https://www.mikroe.com/ata6563-click) carries the [AT6563](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ata6563) high-speed CAN transceiver. The transceiver is designed for high-speed (up to 5 Mbps) CAN applications in the automotive industry, providing differential transmit and receive capability to (a microcontroller with) a CAN protocol controller. It offers improved electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and electrostatic discharge (ESD) performance. The transceiver is CAN FD (Flexible data-rate) ready, meaning it has increased data rates in comparison with classic CAN. Check out the [AT6563 datasheet](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ata6563) for more details.

In this demo application, the [ATA6563 click board](https://www.mikroe.com/ata6563-click) communicates with the WFI32 MCU through **CAN1 Bus Lines**.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/can_pinout_description.png" width=420>
</p>

With PPS, the CAN1 RX Line (C1RX) is routed to pin RPA14.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/can_input_pin_selection.png" width=420>
</p>

And the CAN1 TX Line (C1TX) is routed to pin RPB12.
